    "## Extra Practice With Modulus (%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulus is often the mathematical operator that gives students the most trouble, though it is quite useful.  All modulus does is return the remainder after division happens.  Think way back to when you were first learning long division.  If you were asked to divide 5 by 2 you would not have said 2.5 like you would now.  Back then you would have reported your answer as a whole number \"2\" and a remainder \"1\".  Modulus (%) ignores the whole number portion of the answer and gives you the remainder.  One thing this is useful for is to find if one number divides into another number evenly.  Some examples are below:"
