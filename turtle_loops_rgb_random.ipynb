    "In this example we worked through how to incorporate loops into our turtle drawings.  You were introduced to the [RGB color system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) and how to use it in turtle.  Lastly, we reviewed random numbers and incorporated them into our turtle loop drawing."
