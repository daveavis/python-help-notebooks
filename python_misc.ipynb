    "Adding randomness to a program can make it more interesting.  Games would be boring if the computer did the same thing every time.  There are a variety of ways to get random numbers in Python, here are the ones you will use in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can get a random number you have to tell Python that you want it to load the library that makes random numbers.  This is included with a base Python installation, but Python does not load everything every time it runs.  This would slow Python down and increase the memory requirementes.  Instead, Python allows the programmer to tell it what they need beyond the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For random numbers we need to import the `random` library of methods.  To do that you must put `import random` at the top of your file before any other code (except other imports, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have access to the `random` methods we can use them as shown below."
